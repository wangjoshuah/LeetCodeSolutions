# Add Two Numbers

I have expanded the scope of the original [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)
problem to simulate what an actual interview might look like.

In part 1, I solved the problem iteratively, which is the most straight forward solution.
If you are not able to solve the problem iteratively, you will NOT be passed on to the next round of interviews.

In part 2, I solved the problem or adding two numbers recursively.
This is the more elegant solution and shows that you can work with more complex concepts than for loops and while loops.
I would not recommend answering the question recursively to begin with unless you are VERY confident in your abilities.

In part 3, I solved the problem of adding multiple lists of numbers.
This is the twist the interviewer will throw you after you have solved part 2, to see if you are truly worth hiring.

As with all interviews, the point is to show not just your technical expertise, but also your ability to problem solve.
Even if you are not able to solve all 3 parts in the 45 minutes set aside for the coding part of most technical interviews,
it is important that you show your debugging, testing, and communication skills.
